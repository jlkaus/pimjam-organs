Work on getting the corelib to work on the m164p, and possibly pruning it so its not too huge
Work on getting the bootloader small enough and still useful enough that we might be able to auto-load firmware.
Work on the actual firmware program, and test programs for initial playing around.  Might want to bring in the playground from other projects.
