Add code to setup and talk over the serial line, based on scom.c
Add code to interpret midi events over the serial line and convert to input events, and add to a buffer of unhandled events perhaps?  or a list that can be concerted into a midi file or something.
Add some code in here as well for talking to the device when debugging. Extra in-band messages, two way comms, etc.
